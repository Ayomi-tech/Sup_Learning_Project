### The story

We started our own mobile company and want to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc. We do not know how to estimate price of mobiles our company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem we collected sales data of mobile phones of various companies. We want to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price.In this problem we do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is. There are four classes of price; 0,1,2,3.
